    "##### On the (Statistical) Detection of Adversarial Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two-sample hypothesis testing** — As stated before, the test we chose is appropriate to handle high dimensional inputs and small sample sizes. We compute the biased estimate of MMD using a **Gaussian kernel**, and then apply **10 000 bootstrapping iterations** to estimate the distributions. Based on this, we compute the **pvalue** and compare it to the threshold, in our experiments **0.05**. For samples of **legitimate data, the observed p-value should always be very high**, whereas for sample sets containing adversarial examples, we expect it to be low—since they are sampled from a different distribution and thus the hypothesis should be rejected. The test is more likely to detect a difference in two distributions when it considers samples of large size (i.e., the sample contains more inputs from the distribution)."
